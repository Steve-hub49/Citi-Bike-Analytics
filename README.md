# Citi-Bike-Analytics

## Phenomena Uncovered and Visualized:

### Phenomenon #1: 

Citi Bike usage did increase over the course of the pandemic summer. 

Questions considered:

Did participation increase or decrease across user groups? And when did they ride most often?

The Citi Bike program did grow in popularity over the course of the 2020 pandemic summer. Data analysis tells us that while Customer usage generally declined over the period, the core Subscriber usage increased significantly month over month (up 17.3% in August and 12.8% in September).

Considering collective trip duration by gender, the highest usage across days of the week for men is Saturday and Thursday. For women these are Saturday and Sunday. My assumption was Saturday and Sunday would be most popular for all Citi Bike users; as a result the Thursday finding for men is a bit surprising. Further analysis is required to better understand this phenomenon for men.

The data confirms my assumption that men accumulated a higher total trip duration over the summer months than women. 

### Phenomenon #2: 

Given population centers within the NYC boroughs, Citi Bike users utilized a select number of start and end stations more often than others during the pandemic summer. 

Questions considered:

Where did user routes most commonly begin and end? And did the Top Ten start stations match the Top Ten end stations utilized?

Gazing across a map of the NYC start station activity, it is apparent that usage increased over the course of the 2020 summer months. This is evidenced by the general darkening of station markers across time.

As a side note and assessing count by start station, it is interesting to note that the top three stations (Newport Pkwy, Liberty Light Rail, and Grove St PATH) account for 18.7% of total activity. Considering the total number of start stations across a large metropolitan area such as the NYC boroughs, I expected more of an even spread across all (in other words, a shorter pyramid).

Considering zip code, it is apparent that the top ten most popular start stations span multiple zip codes. These are high volume stations.

Even among this limited group, the top start station (Newport Pkwy) comprised 15.4% of this group's activity.

Looking at zip code from the end of the journey perspective, it is again apparent that the top ten most popular end stations span multiple zip codes. These are also high volume stations.

Not necessarily surprising, the same top ten stations comprise both the start and end station lists. It is noteworthy that even among this limited group, the top end station (Newport Pkwy) comprised 15.2% of this group's activity.

While not fully conclusive, this finding supports my hypothesis that Citi Bike usage would increase over the course of the pandemic summer. Given work from home restrictions (far fewer automobile commutes to work) and perhaps general boredom, it stands to reason that Citi Bike likely benefitted from such pandemic impacts.

### Task

Your task in this assignment is to aggregate the data found in the Citi Bike Trip History Logs and find two unexpected phenomena.

Design 2-5 visualizations for each discovered phenomena (4-10 total). You may work with a timespan of your choosing. Optionally, you may merge multiple datasets from different periods.

Use your visualizations (does not have to be all of them) to design a dashboard for each phenomena.

The dashboards should be accompanied with an analysis explaining why the phenomena may be occurring.

City officials would also like to see one of the following visualizations:

Basic: A static map that plots all bike stations with a visual indication of the most popular locations to start and end a journey with zip code data overlaid on top (I performed this activity).

Create a Tableau story that brings together the visualizations, requested maps, and dashboards.

### Submission:

Your final submission should include:

A link to your Tableau Public workbook that includes:

4-10 Total "Phenomenon" Visualizations
2 Dashboards
1 City Official Map
1 Story

A text or markdown file with your analysis on the phenomenons you uncovered from the data.
